  gardenWorldEvents:
  - 'A garden world. A famous poet lives here, a hermit. You give them a wide berth.


    The
    planet is beautiful.'
  - 'A lucious garden world, covered in rainforests. The people of this world have
    three eyes.



    Their eyes remain closed from the time they are born until
    the day of their death, when they open their eyes to observe their first and
    final sunset.'
  - 'A garden world with spectacularly iridescent sunsets. The people are joyful
    and full of laughter.



    They invite you to feast and play music, and you
    smile and laugh with them, but the gravity of this planet is stronger than you
    can stand, and eventually you must move on.'
  - A garden world. Violent storms play across its surface. The people here have
    seen many disasters. You wonder why they don't leave, and they tell you that
    this is their home.
  - 'A garden world. Where the ocean meets the land, waves beat violently against
    rocky cliffs.


    You stay for a time, losing yourself in the motion of the
    planet.'
  - 'A thriving garden world, covered in bright multicolored foliage.


    Strange,
    irregular structures dot the surface, perhaps the remains of a long forgotten
    civilization.'
  - 'A garden world populated by very busy people. They are friendly, but your body
    is different from their bodies and that makes them uncomfortable.


    You don''t
    stay long.'
  - 'A garden world. Metallic scars vein the surface, like some kind of giant circuitry.


    As
    you try to enter upper atmosphere, a mysterious force repels your ship.'
  - 'A garden world, populated by jellyfish people. They drift calmly through the
    seas. They live long lives, and care little for the surface world.


    It''s
    hard to say, but they seem content.'
  - A garden world. The ground is always muddy, even in the arid regions. You spy
    a bone lodged in the muck.
  - A garden world. Tall, carnivorous trees drift slowly across the continents.
  - A garden world. As far as you can tell, only goats live here. The goats look
    very happy.
  - 'A garden world. The sky is a soft, gentle pink dotted with puffball clouds.


    The
    people here have large smiles across their faces. Their teeth are filed to points.'
  - A garden world. The people of this planet breathe a different atmosphere. They
    are happy. You imagine what it must be like to walk among them unmasked.
  rockyPlanetEvents:
  - 'A lifeless chunk of rock without atmosphere, hurtling through the void.


    There
    is nothing of interest here.'
  - 'A rocky world without atmosphere. The pitted formations on the surface cast
    strange shadows.


    Large symbols are carved into the surface in a language
    few can understand:



    "Hail, Wanderer."'
  - 'A rocky world without atmosphere or notable features, except for another message
    carved into the into the surface:



    "I leave this message in the hopes that
    one like me might find it. If you can read this, we must be the same. Wanderers."'
  - 'A rocky world without atmosphere. Another message is carved into the into the
    surface:



    "I do not know how long I have wandered. People and places come
    and go. Never have I met anyone else like me. Like us, I suppose."'
  - 'A rocky world without atmosphere. Another message is carved into the into the
    surface:



    "I have seen so many strange and wonderful things. People both
    delightful and terrible. Planets, beautiful and hellish.



    There are monsters
    in this galaxy, but also there is hope."'
  - 'A rocky world without atmosphere. Another message is carved into the into the
    surface:



    "Perhaps no one will find these writings. Maybe everyone who
    can understand them is gone.



    But I have to believe. Otherwise, I am alone."'
  - 'A rocky world without atmosphere. Another message is carved into the into the
    surface:



    "I made an error, and nearly ran out of fuel.



    It is easy
    to forget how closely death tails us, out here in the darkness. Fuel is life.
    Never forget that, dear Wanderer."'
  - 'A rocky world without atmosphere. Strange symbols are carved into the surface,
    but it''s not a language you recognize.



    It doesn''t look like writing
    at all, in fact, but a drawing of a face. Its stony eyes gaze out into the void.
    They remind you of your own.'
  - 'A rocky world without atmosphere. Another message is carved into the into the
    surface:



    "I wish I could know you, Wanderer. We are both alike, both alone.
    I hope my words make you feel a little less so.



    Know that you are cherished,
    Wanderer."'
  - 'A rocky world without atmosphere. Another message is carved into the into the
    surface:



    "I am sorry. I have failed. My fuel reserves are gone, and I
    do not think I will make it to my next destination.



    Please, dear Wanderer,
    if you find this: take my chisel. Make it your voice as I have before you.



    I
    do not know what we are looking for. I do not know if we can ever find it. Until
    we do, all you can do is carve your name among the stars."



    The end'
  gasGiantEvents:
  - 'A gas giant. Clouds twist and swirl in mesmerizing patterns. You wonder what
    secrets lurk beneath the atmosphere.



    The gasses of this world can fuel
    your ship.'
