Garden world encounters:

--- 1

The people of this planet breathe a different atmosphere. They are happy. You imagine what it must be like to walk among them unmasked.

--- 2

A lucious garden world, covered in rainforests. The people of this world have three eyes. Their eyes remain closed from the time they are born until the day of their death, when they are permitted to open them and observe their first and final sunset.

--- 3

An thriving garden world, covered in bright multicolored foliage. Strange, irregular structures dot the surface, perhaps the remains of a long-gone civilization.

--- 4

A garden world populated by very busy people. They are friendly, but your body is different from their bodies and that makes them uncomfortable. You don't stay long.

--- 5

A garden world with spectacularly iridescent sunsets. The people are joyful and full of laughter. They invite you to feast and play music, and you smile and laugh with them, but the gravity of this planet is stronger than is comfortable for you, and eventually you must move on.

--- 6

A garden world. Where the ocean meets the land, waves beat violently against rocky cliffs. You stay for a time, losing yourself in the motion of the planet.

--- 7

A garden world. Violent storms play across its surface. The people here have seen many disasters. You wonder why they don't leave, and they tell you that this is their home.

--- 8

A garden world. Tall, carnivorous trees drift slowly across the continents.

--- 9

A garden world. The sky is a gentle pink, dotted with puffball clouds. The people here have large smiles across their faces. Their teeth are filed to points. You do not stay long.

--- 10

A garden world. The ground is always muddy, even in the arid regions. You spy a bone lodged in the muck.

--- 11

A garden world. Metallic scars vein the surface, like some kind of giant circuitry. As you try to enter the atmosphere, a mysterious force pushes you away.

--- 12

A garden world. As far as you can tell, only goats live here. The goats are very happy.

--- 13

A garden world. A famous poet lives here, a hermit. You give them a wide berth. The planet is beautiful.

--- 14

A garden world, populated by jellyfish people. They drift calmly through the seas. They live long lives, and care little for the surface world. It's hard to say, but they seem content.

Messages from the Wanderer:

--- 1

A lifeless chunk of rock without atmosphere, hurtling through the void. There is nothing here.

--- 2

A rocky world without atmosphere. The pitted formations on the surface cast strange shadows. Large symbols are carved into the surface in a language few can understand:

"Hail, Wanderer."

--- 3

A rocky world without atmosphere or notable features, except for another message carved into the into the surface:

"I leave this message in the hopes that one like me might find it. If you are reading this, then that is you."

--- 4

A rocky world without atmosphere. Another message is carved into the into the surface:

"I do not know how long I have wandered. People and places come and go. Never have I met anyone else like me. Like us, I suppose."

--- 5

A rocky world without atmosphere. Another message is carved into the into the surface:

"I have seen so many strange and wonderful things. People both delightful and terrible. Planets, beautiful and hellish. There are monsters in this galaxy, but also there is hope."

--- 6

A rocky world without atmosphere. Another message is carved into the into the surface:

"Perhaps no one will find these writings. Maybe everyone who can understand them is gone. But I have to believe. Otherwise, I am alone."

--- 8

A rocky world without atmosphere. Another message is carved into the into the surface:

"I made an error, and nearly ran out of fuel. It is easy to forget how closely death tails us, out here in the darkness. Fuel is life. Never forget that."

"Sometimes I find a planet and wish that I could belong there."

--- 10

A rocky world without atmosphere. Another message is carved into the into the surface:

"Where am I from? I do not remember anymore."

--- 11

A rocky world without atmosphere. Strange symbols are carved into the surface, but it's not a language you recognize. It doesn't look like writing at all, in fact, but an artistic rendition of a face.

Its stony eyes gaze out into the void. They remind you of your own.

--- 12

A rocky world without atmosphere. Another message is carved into the into the surface:

"I wish I could know you, Wanderer. We are both alike, both alone. I hope my words make you feel a little less so. By imagining you reading this, I feel less alone. Know that you are cherished, Wanderer."

--- 13

A rocky world without atmosphere. Another message is carved into the into the surface:

"I am sorry. I have failed. My fuel reserves are gone, and I do not think I will make it to my next destination. Please, dear Wanderer, if you find this: take my chisel. Make it your voice as I have before you.

I don’t know what we’re looking for. I don’t know if we’ll ever find it. All you can do in the meantime is carve your name among the stars."
